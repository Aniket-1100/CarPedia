            This generation marked the rebirth of the GT-R legend. Introduced in 1989, the R32 GT-R was powered by a
            2.6-liter twin-turbocharged inline-six engine, known as the RB26DETT, producing around 276 horsepower
            (though rumored to have significantly more). It featured advanced technology like ATTESA E-TS all-wheel
            drive and Super-HICAS four-wheel steering, dominating motorsport competitions such as Group A racing. The
            third generation of the Nissan Skyline, often referred to as the R32 generation, encompasses a wide
            range of models, including the iconic Skyline GT-R. The GT-R variant of the R32 generation is arguably the
            most famous and celebrated model. It featured the RB26DETT engine producing around 276 horsepower, advanced
            all-wheel-drive system, and advanced handling
            technologies. The R32 GT-R earned the nickname "Godzilla" due to its dominance in motorsport.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>1. Engine Options:</h2>
        The R32 GT-R is powered by Nissan's iconic RB26DETT engine, a 2.6-liter twin-turbocharged inline-six. It
        produces approximately 276 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, although many enthusiasts believe the actual
        output to be higher. The engine features dual overhead camshafts and 24 valves. Engine options varied across
        different trim levels and models. Notable engines included inline-four and inline-six configurations, with
        displacements ranging from 1.8L to 2.6L.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>2. Trim Levels:</h2>
        The Nissan Skyline GT-R third generation, also known as the R32, was primarily offered in a single trim level,
        the GT-R. However, within the GT-R lineup, there were a few variations and special editions produced during its
        production run from 1989 to 1994.
        <ul>
            <li>Standard R32 GT-R: This is the base model of the R32 GT-R, equipped with the iconic RB26DETT engine,
                ATTESA E-TS all-wheel-drive system, Super-HICAS four-wheel steering, and other performance-oriented
                features. It came with standard interior amenities and minimal optional extras.</li><br>

            <li>Nismo Edition: Nismo (Nissan Motorsports International Co., Ltd.) offered performance-enhanced versions
                of the R32 GT-R. These editions typically featured upgraded suspension components, exhaust systems, and
                aerodynamic enhancements. The Nismo R32 GT-Rs were produced in limited numbers and are highly sought
                after by enthusiasts.</li><br>

            <li>V-Spec (Victory Specification): Introduced in 1993, the V-Spec was a higher-performance variant of the
                R32 GT-R. It featured upgrades such as larger brakes, stiffer suspension, a front LSD (Limited Slip
                Differential), and a reinforced body structure. The V-Spec aimed to improve handling and overall
                performance on the track.</li><br>

            <li>V-Spec II: This variant, introduced later in the R32 GT-R's production cycle, further refined the
                enhancements introduced with the V-Spec. It featured revised suspension settings and additional
                weight-saving measures, making it even more track-focused than the standard V-Spec.</li><br>
        </ul>
