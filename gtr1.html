            The first Skyline GT-R, known internally as PGC10, made its debut on February 4, 1969.
            Initially exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealerships under the Nissan Prince Store, this high-performance car
            was born from the merger of Nissan and Prince Motors in 1966.
            The early Skyline GT-Rs were produced between 1969 and 1972, carrying the model code KPGC10.
            These cars quickly gained fame by dominating Japanese touring car racing events. Although their production
            run was short-lived, they continued the legacy of performance excellence. The Nissan Skyline GT-R, often
            referred to as the "Hakosuka" (which translates to "boxy Skyline" in Japanese).</p>
